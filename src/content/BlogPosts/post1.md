# Summit: Hiking to the top of Mt Holyoke

I recently climbed to the top of Mt Holyoke in western mass. It is the western most peak in the Holyoke Range within Skinner State Park. It was an easy climb but there were a lot of bugs that made the climb arduous. It was really satisfying to reach the top and see the town of Northamptom and Umass in the distance. It was a meager 935 feet of elevation but it's a good start!
